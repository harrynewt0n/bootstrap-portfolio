# bootstrap-portfolio
A personal portfolio built using Bootstrap HTML and CSS elements.
## Description
Within this project, I was able to recreate my personal web-development portfolio using various versions of the 'Bootstrap' library. I was able to incorporate prebuilt components and elements, to act as the base layout for my portfolio page, before adding customised style via my own CSS style sheet.

The webpage displays various sections and components, including a navigation bar, a jumbotron that includes my photo and an introduction, a 'My Work' section with card components that display my various projects, and finally a skills and contact me section.

## Installation
The application requires no installation as it is a live webpage.

## Usage
To utilise this application you can visit the webpage by following this URL: *Insert URL*

This should open up at webpage that looks like this: *Insert Screenshot*

You can navigate to the various sections by clicking on them in the nav bar, which will direct you to the correct section of the webpage.

By clicking on the project cards, you will be redirected to the deployed application of that project.
